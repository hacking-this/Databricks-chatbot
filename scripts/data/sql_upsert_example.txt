# Upsert with SQL and MERGE

Databricks SQL enables upserts using the `MERGE` command.

## Sample:
```sql
MERGE INTO customers AS target
USING staging_customers AS source
ON target.id = source.id
WHEN MATCHED THEN
  UPDATE SET target.name = source.name
WHEN NOT MATCHED THEN
  INSERT (id, name) VALUES (source.id, source.name);
```

## Notes:
- Very useful for data deduplication and change tracking.
- Can be executed on a schedule with SQL workflows.
