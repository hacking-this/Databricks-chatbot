# MERGE INTO for Upserts in Delta Lake

Delta Lake supports MERGE INTO for handling updates and inserts (upserts) efficiently.

## Syntax:
```sql
MERGE INTO target_table [AS target]
USING source_table [AS source]
ON condition
WHEN MATCHED THEN UPDATE SET ...
WHEN NOT MATCHED THEN INSERT ...
```

## Example:
```sql
MERGE INTO target AS t
USING updates AS u
ON t.id = u.id
WHEN MATCHED THEN
  UPDATE SET t.name = u.name
WHEN NOT MATCHED THEN
  INSERT (id, name) VALUES (u.id, u.name);
```

## Notes:
- Great for slowly changing dimensions (SCD).
- Supports nested conditions and expressions.
